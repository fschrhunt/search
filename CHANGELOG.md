# Changelog

## Unreleased

- **Read whole pages.** Extraction no longer cuts raw HTML at 120,000 characters,
  which lost the article on large pages (Wikipedia returned its contents list,
  GitHub its "Skip to content" link) without reporting truncation. Readability
  no longer gives up past 40,000 elements. `fetch.max_response_bytes` (now 16 MiB)
  bounds the download only; a body cut there reports `truncated`.
- Articles are returned as Markdown: headings, lists, tables and fenced code
  keep their structure, and code keeps its indentation and literal brackets
  (`vec![1]`, `#![allow(...)]`). Listing pages fall back to plain text without
  navigation, sidebars, site header/footer or scripts, and keep their `<title>`.
- Decode pages from their declared charset (header or `<meta>`) instead of
  forcing UTF-8, so Shift_JIS, GBK, windows-1252 and similar pages read correctly.
- Read PDF text layers. Refuse images, archives and other binaries by content
  type instead of returning them as replacement-character noise; text types
  (JSON, XML, source, plain text) are returned as text.
- Follow only prompt `<meta http-equiv="refresh">` redirects. Search no longer
  guesses redirects from scripts or lone links, which replaced error pages with
  their "Go home" target and app shells with an arbitrary URL from their scripts.
- Stop removing visible content: hidden-text and boilerplate filters match whole
  class tokens and segments and parse inline styles, so `overflow-hidden`,
  `lead-paragraph`, negative margins and responsive `hidden md:block` content are
  kept, and a furniture-named wrapper never removes the article inside it.
- Fix the image exfiltration guard: images nested in links (the README badge
  pattern `[![alt](img)](link)`) and inside brackets survived extraction. Image
  syntax is now neutralized everywhere, and link reference definitions are broken
  so reference-style images cannot resolve.
- Read pages in windows without losing anything: `web_fetch` and `search fetch`
  return `next_offset` when a page continues past `max_characters`, and accept
  `offset` (`-offset`) to read on. The 40,000-character ceiling on
  `max_characters` is removed. Focused passages match whole words (`is` no longer
  matches `this`), match inside CJK text, and are returned in reading order. The
  CLI and MCP share one implementation, `core::text::focus`.
- The paired HTTPS host has one JSON API. `POST /v1/execute` is removed; paired
  CLI and stdio MCP clients use `GET /v1/search`, `POST /v1/fetch` and
  `GET /v1/status`. `POST /v1/fetch` returns `{"pages":[...]}` in input order.
- An omitted `limit` on `GET /v1/search` and MCP `web_search` uses the host's
  `search.max_results` instead of a fixed 10; requests stay capped at 50.
- CLI, MCP and HTTP share one set of input bounds (1–512-byte queries, 1–10 URLs
  of at most 8192 bytes). Local `search fetch` now refuses more than 10 URLs.
- **Breaking:** engines are defined in settings instead of installed packages.
  `engines.use` selects IDs; `engines.config.ID` overrides the built-in `mwmbl`
  and `searxng` presets or defines a custom `http`/`command` adapter. Settings are
  trusted operator configuration: a command entry runs that program. Command
  engines take an absolute `command` or a bare name on `PATH`, and an optional
  absolute `cwd` (default: the command's directory, else its private scratch
  directory). Remove `search install`, `update`, `remove`, `engines available`,
  `enable --trust`, and the package store (`SEARCH_HOME/engines`), manifests,
  receipts and leases; a running agent no longer blocks engine changes. To keep a
  custom package, move its manifest `adapter` into `engines.config.ID`.
- Engine commands are `search engines [list]`, `configure`, `enable`, `disable`
  and `test`; `test` prints results like a search (`-json` for JSON).
- **Breaking Rust API:** the engine runtime moved to `search::core::engines`;
  `Query`, `Answer` and `Link` are defined in `search::core`, removing the
  core↔engines dependency cycle. The `Engine` trait returns `Found`.
- One invalid result row (such as an empty Mwmbl title) no longer fails the whole
  engine: invalid rows are skipped and reported as `skipped` in engine status.
- URL deduplication keeps the `ref` query parameter, which selects branches on
  code hosts. A panicking engine is reported under its own name.
- A leading `-config PATH` applies to the command that follows
  (`search -config PATH fetch URL`).
- Add native x86_64/ARM64 CI and release builds for Linux, macOS, and Windows;
  publish Windows ZIPs and a checksummed PowerShell installer, and test installers
  on their native systems. Use runner-local temporary paths for security tests.
- Tighten the SSRF guard: refuse the `0.0.0.0/8` "this network" block, local-use
  NAT64 `64:ff9b:1::/48` addresses that embed a private or reserved IPv4 (RFC
  8215), and the `3fff::/20` documentation range (RFC 9637), with counterexample
  tests beside the existing ones.
- Follow exactly the configured number of HTTP redirects: a budget of `N` now
  allows `N` redirects, not `N` more taken than intended.
- Recover engine-store mutations when a crash interrupts the cleanup of a
  replaced package tree and its lease file is already gone — recreating the
  lease when the old tree is restored — instead of wedging all later installs,
  updates, and removals.
- Route executable-engine scratch files through a per-user private directory
  under the OS temp root via `TMPDIR`, `TMP`, and `TEMP`, so shared hosts cannot
  collide or lock each other out of the default location. Configure `temp_dir`
  to override the location; unsafe directories fail closed. Files are not
  automatically cleaned up, and executable engines remain unsandboxed.
- Match fetched-page passages case-insensitively for non-ASCII letters (such as
  `Ü`/`ü`), not only ASCII, so accented queries find their paragraphs.
- Add focused navigation READMEs for configuration, fetching, and CLI internals,
  and expand the existing engine module guide.
- Consolidate shipped engine assets and their Rust implementation under
  `src/engines/`; move the runnable custom POST starter into `docs/examples/`.
  Installed engine locations and package contracts are unchanged.
- Make `./x` argument handling consistent: show command help, forward formatting
  arguments, and reject unexpected arguments to shell and guard checks.
- Keep search orchestration opt-in and bounded: only Mwmbl runs by default,
  additional engines require explicit activation, the per-engine deadline is
  five seconds, and unavailable selections produce an explicit engine error.
- Preserve literal square brackets in fetched code and prose while continuing
  to neutralize Markdown link/image targets.
- Show failed and timed-out engines in terminal search output without exposing
  program stderr or credential values.
- Focused fetches with no matching passages return bounded page text rather than
  labelling the opening as a match; preserve truncation metadata for that fallback.
- **Breaking Rust API:** consolidate into one root `search` package and library,
  with the `search` CLI binary. Import `search::core::{Search, Config, Query,
  Answer, Page, Link}`, `search::engines::{Engine, Pool}` and package APIs,
  `search::client::Client`, and `search::mcp::Server` directly; old facade imports
  and separate crate names are removed. Default `cli` includes MCP and hosting;
  minimal and MCP-only library builds are supported. Modules replace compilation
  boundaries; conventions and boundary tests enforce dependency direction.
  Manifest schema 1, command protocol 1, and on-disk formats remain unchanged.
  Binary upgrades do not replace installed engines, settings, or credentials.

- Refresh onboarding, engine integration, hosting, and contributor documentation;
  prefer `search help` and `search version`, clarify setup prerequisites, and
  align CLI help and diagnostics with the primary commands.
- Add `./x help` and make installer help work when read from stdin as well as a
  saved script. Keep existing help/version flag aliases for compatibility.
- Define manifest schema 1 and command protocol 1 as stable engine contracts
  across Search releases. Document the shared store/runtime for shipped and
  custom engines and protect installed custom packages with a compatibility test.
- Bound paired-host responses with `remote.max_response_bytes` (default 64 MiB)
  and align CLI focused reads with the 6000-character MCP default. Explicit CLI
  character limits must be 1–40000; unmatched queries fall back to page text.
- Engine management commands reserve their first word; use `search -- QUERY`
  when a literal query begins with a command name.
- Bound ephemeral fetch caching with `fetch.cache_bytes` (default 32 MiB),
  accounting for string payloads and entry overhead. Zero disables storage;
  oversized pages skip caching, and full caches clear all entries.

- Re-check HTTP redirect destinations before dialing and ignore environment
  proxies in the page reader, so neither can bypass the SSRF guard.
- **Breaking:** remove the persistent local corpus, index/refresh commands, and
  corpus API. Reject `dir`, `search.local_weight`, `fetch.max_stored_chars`, and
  `index` settings; remove `DIR`/`-dir`. Existing files and data are untouched.
  Search now uses live web engines and clean fetch with a transient memory cache.
- **Breaking:** rename user selection/attribution fields from `providers` to
  `engines` and CLI `-providers` to `-engines`. Rename core `discovery` to
  `engines`, `Provider` to `Engine`, `Finding` to `Link`, `Response` to `Answer`,
  `Fetched` to `Page`, `Registry` to `Pool`, and `AdapterProvider` to `Adapter`.
  The service remains `Search`; package transport configuration remains `adapter`.
- Move shared local/remote execution into `search::client`;
  MCP owns only tools and transports. Retain optional paired HTTPS hosting and
  remote routing without local fallback.
- MCP fetch with no query or character limit returns the full clean page under
  the fetch transport body bound. Explicit `max_characters` accepts 1–40000;
  query-focused reads default to 6000 characters per page.
- Reduce the shipped catalog to Mwmbl and SearXNG. Remove vendor API and scraper
  packages and their helpers; existing installed packages/settings are untouched.
  Custom HTTP and command engines still merge concurrently. Document AI/API
  integrations with a tested, copyable authenticated JSON POST starter outside
  the catalog. `search install NAME|./PATH` is the primary installation command;
  `search engines install` remains an alias.
- Document language-independent executable engines, an offline starter, declared
  runtimes/credentials, and native-binary packaging.
- Replace special built-in engines with installable packages and local lifecycle
  commands; shipped assets live under `src/engines/`. `SEARCH_HOME` selects packages, settings, and
  separate private trust storage. Updates preserve user settings and package
  edits; executables inherit only declared credentials and a minimal environment.
  Release builds target the root package with the default `cli` feature.
- Add configurable JSON HTTP and executable engine transports, bounded output,
  guarded endpoints, ranking/deadlines, and local `search engines list/test`
  diagnostics. Reject missing explicit settings files and invalid zero bounds;
  zero cache/redirect settings disable those features. Require current-user
  ownership of trust storage and remove unused search-cache/log-level settings.

- Add `search pair-code` to renew one-use host pairing codes without restarting.
  Persist only code hashes and admission bounds under a process lock.

- Replace shared HTTP tokens with persistent paired HTTPS identities and revocable
  per-device credentials. Add `remote pair/use/list/off/remove`, `devices`, and
  `revoke`; selected remotes execute CLI and stdio MCP operations without fallback.
- Remove `token`/`token_env` with no compatibility aliases.

- Validate MCP tool inputs, run batch searches concurrently, and return structured
  results. Fetched pages report their fetch time. Runtime settings use
  `settings.json` and consistent snake_case names without compatibility aliases.
- Enforce the configured maximum result count and whole-search deadline, fail startup if the
  guarded HTTP client cannot be built, and make the fetch-cache expiry test deterministic.
- Organize the single `search` package around protocol-free `core`, runtime
  and package `engines`, shared `client`, and optional `mcp`/`cli` modules.
  The engine exposes `search::core::Search`; minimal library builds omit MCP.
- Added theme-aware black and white lockup/logo SVGs, and used the lockup at the
  top of the README.
- Reframed the README around Search's core promise and clarified getting
  started, adoption, configuration, and security.
- Extraction keeps the article and drops the cruft: ads, cookie banners,
  related rails, and hidden text are removed, and links and images are
  neutralized so page content cannot exfiltrate. A page that only redirects
  elsewhere is now followed to its target.
- `web_fetch` supports query-focused passages and optional character limits;
  remove the unused `objective` parameter.
- Fetched pages carry byline, published time, and site for citation.
- A link's `engines` attribution is a JSON array.

## Unreleased (before this change)

- The first Rust implementation: one binary serving multi-provider discovery, a
  hardened fetcher, a private full-text index, and MCP over stdio and HTTP.
- Release tooling: `scripts/release.sh` (name the changelog section, then tag),
  `scripts/formula.sh` (the Homebrew formula), and `install.sh` (the
  checksum-verified installer), with CI and a tag workflow that builds archives,
  attests provenance, updates the formula, and installs the release.
- Documentation and contribution: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/` for users and
  `docs/contributing/` for the project, issue and pull-request templates, and a
  `./x check` that includes a shell-syntax check.
