# Working on search

Instructions for an agent editing this repo.

## Build and check

```sh
./x build          # fast dev build
./x test           # the whole behavioral contract
./x check          # format, lint, tests, shell syntax, and the security-surface guard
./x shell          # shell-script syntax alone
./x guard          # the security-surface audit alone
./x serve          # the JSON API and MCP over HTTP (dev build)
./x stdio          # MCP over stdio (what an agent spawns)
```

`./x check` is not optional. It runs formatting and linting, Cargo checks for
all features, minimal features, and MCP-only features, package tests, a syntax
check of every shell script, and `scripts/guard.sh`.

## Where things live

Search is one root Cargo package, with library `search` and CLI binary `search`.
`search::core` provides protocol-free live discovery and clean fetch;
`search::core::engines` runs the engines defined in settings, without per-engine
Rust code. CLI and MCP share local/remote execution through
`search::client::Client`; MCP owns only tools and transports. Module conventions,
boundary tests and `scripts/guard.sh` preserve dependency direction; separate
crate compilation no longer enforces it.

`--no-default-features` builds core (with engines) and client without protocol
or CLI dependencies. `--no-default-features --features mcp` adds MCP only. The
default `cli` feature includes `mcp` and optional hosting/authentication
dependencies; `mcp` enables optional `rmcp`.

## Conventions

- **Shipped code denies explicit panic sites.** `src/lib.rs` denies
  `clippy::unwrap_used`, `expect_used`, `panic`, `unreachable`, and
  `indexing_slicing`. Every allowed site carries a `proof:` comment or a scoped
  `#[allow]` explaining why runtime input cannot reach it. `scripts/guard.sh`
  enforces the same rule.
- **The core is protocol-free.** `search::core::Search` is the public in-process
  engine. MCP, CLI and client depend on core; core (including `core::engines`)
  must not depend on any of them. `scripts/guard.sh` enforces the direction.
- **The security-critical file is `src/core/fetch/guard.rs`.** A URL is model-chosen, so
  every class of address that can reach infrastructure must be classified
  private, and `check_host` strips IPv6 brackets before parsing an address. The
  guard's tests carry the counterexamples; do not loosen them.
- **Engines live in settings.** `engines.use` selects IDs (default `mwmbl`, the
  single keyless default); `engines.config.ID` defines each one. The `mwmbl` and
  `searxng` presets are adapter objects in `src/core/config/engines.rs`, merged
  shallowly with their entry and never changing `type`; any other ID is a
  complete `http` or `command` adapter. No per-engine Rust code. HTTP adapters
  read credential headers from configured environment variables. Command
  adapters are trusted host code, not a sandbox; only declared environment
  credentials are passed through. An invalid result row is skipped and counted,
  not fatal. An engine's `EngineState` reports its `EngineStatus`, so an empty
  answer is never mistaken for a broken one. Binary upgrades must not rewrite
  settings.
- **Settings are trusted operator configuration.** They can define executables,
  so they are not shareable data: never load settings or engines implicitly from
  the working directory or from request input. `SEARCH_HOME` selects the root,
  defaulting to `~/.search`. Engine management is local-only; CLI settings writes
  are locked, atomic and owner-only. Trust stays under home/trust.
- **Don't hardcode what a user might change.** Timeouts, result counts, the user
  agent, and the enabled engines are read from configuration with built-in
  defaults. A new user-facing behaviour becomes a config field, not a constant.
- **Keep the vocabulary consistent.** `search::core` exposes `Search`, `Config`,
  `Query`, `Answer`, `Page`, and `Link`. `search::core::engines` exposes `Engine`,
  `Pool`, `EngineState`, `EngineStatus`, `EngineError`, and `Found`. Fetch returns
  `Page`; user fields and CLI selection use `engines` and `-engines`; an engine's
  `engines.config` entry is its adapter. Use native module imports, without old
  facade aliases or separate client/engine crate names.
- **Separate settings from execution.** `Config` is inert data, without resolved
  transports. Transport settings are `core::config::Adapter`,
  `core::config::Http`, and `core::config::Command`; `EngineSettings::adapter`
  resolves an ID. `Pool` owns running adapters; HTTP engines reuse one client. CLI authentication lives in
  `src/cli/auth.rs`; on-disk trust filenames stay unchanged.
- **No persistent corpus.** Search and fetch use live engines and a transient
  fetch cache. Old corpus settings are rejected; existing files/data are untouched.
- **Never truncate content silently.** `fetch.max_response_bytes` bounds work and
  memory, not what a reader gets: extraction never cuts text, a body cut at the
  byte bound reports `truncated`, and a character window reports `next_offset`.
  Readers choose how much to read through `core::text::focus`; CLI and MCP must
  not reimplement it.
- **Extraction must be precise before it is aggressive.** A false removal loses
  the article; match class tokens and segments and parse styles, never substrings.
  Image markup must not survive in any output (prose, code, nested links, reference
  definitions). Pin each behavior with a counterexample from a real page.
- **Validate inputs once.** Query, limit and URL bounds live in `search::client`
  (`validate_query`, `validate_search`, `validate_urls`). HTTP, MCP and `Client`
  call them; do not repeat the numbers elsewhere. The paired host exposes one REST
  API, which remote `Client`s also use.
- **Comment modules and functions with their purpose and contract.** Avoid
  line-by-line comments. Update a comment when the behavior it describes changes.
- **One concern per PR.** The branch is `<type>/<slug>`; the title is
  conventional (`fix(search): ...`), because it becomes the squash commit on main.
- Anything user-visible gets a `CHANGELOG.md` entry under `Unreleased`.
