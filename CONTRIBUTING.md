Search is a self-hosted web search service in Rust. This is how to change it.

## Getting set up

Rust 1.98 is pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml`; `rustup` will install it on first
build. Install Python 3 as well: the package tests use it for offline command
adapter fixtures and the custom engine example. The shipped HTTP engines do
not need Python at runtime.

```sh
./x build     # build the development binary
./x check     # what a pull request must pass
```

`./x check` runs, in order:

- `./x fmt --check` — `cargo fmt --all --check`
- `./x lint` — `cargo clippy --locked --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`,
  including the all-features build check
- `cargo check --locked --no-default-features` and
  `cargo check --locked --no-default-features --features mcp` — minimal and MCP-only builds
- `./x test` — the package tests
- `./x shell` — syntax checks for `x`, `install.sh`, and `scripts/*.sh`
- `./x guard` — `scripts/guard.sh`, the security-surface audit

CI runs `./x check` natively on Linux, macOS, and Windows, each on x86_64 and ARM64.
Tests use local fixtures and mock servers, not live engine queries. Unix CI
points `TMPDIR` at the runner's temporary directory to avoid macOS's symlinked
`/var` path. Windows security fixtures use user-profile temporary storage rather
than shared runner directories whose ownership/ACLs may legitimately be refused.

Windows contributors need Visual Studio's C++ build tools/Windows SDK, Python,
and Git Bash for `./x`. Run `cargo build --locked` directly from PowerShell for
a normal build. CI also tests the PowerShell installer against local release
fixtures, including update and checksum failure. Windows ARM64 CI uses GitHub's
native ARM runner; no local Windows device is needed to contribute.

`./x` defaults to `check` and does not rewrite source files or lockfiles.
`./x help` lists commands. Build, fmt, lint, and test forward Cargo arguments;
for example, `./x build --release` or `./x test guard`.
`./x fmt` formats files; `./x fmt --check` only checks them. `check`, `shell`,
and `guard` reject extra arguments.

## What a change needs

- **One concern per pull request.** If the description says "also", split it.
- **A test for each behavior change.** The regression test should fail against
  the unfixed code, for the reason the fix names.
- **A `CHANGELOG.md` entry** under `Unreleased` for anything user-visible.
- **Updated docs and comments.** A stale comment is worse than none.

`scripts/guard.sh` pins promises Search makes — the network hosts it may reach,
the panic-site policy, the SSRF guard, the auth layer. A change that legitimately
moves one of those boundaries updates the guard in the same diff, where review
can see it. Never work around it.

## Where things go

The file map and conventions are in [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md); module contracts and
layering are in the [architecture guide](docs/contributing/architecture.md).
Shipped and custom engines use the same version-1 manifest, command protocol,
and package store. See [engine packages](docs/engines.md) before adding one.

## Branches, commits and pull requests

- Before the first push, name the branch `<type>/<slug>`, for example
  `fix/rebinding-guard` or `docs/remote-setup`. Never push `main` directly.
- Conventional commit titles, plain language: `fix(search): close the DNS
  rebinding gap`. The type is `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`,
  or `chore`; the scope is `search`, `engines`, `cli`, `mcp`, `infra`, or `docs`.
- The title becomes the squash commit on `main`; write it as the one line someone
  reads in `git log`.
- Use the pull request template. Explain the problem, what changed, and why it
  works. List the checks you ran and their results.

## Releasing

See [docs/contributing/releases.md](docs/contributing/releases.md).

## Conduct and security

Be straightforward and kind in issues and reviews. Report a vulnerability the way
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) describes, not in a public issue.
